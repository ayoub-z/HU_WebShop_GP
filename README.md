# HU_WebShop_GP

This is our recommendation engine project.
Right now, we have a simple algorithm implemented. To be able to view this, you will need to have the database setup as supplied by the HU.
Then in order to run this, make sure you open popu_prod and change the database variables, and let it fill the table populairste_prod.
Now, run huw.sh and huw_recommend.sh, and navigate to 127.0.0.1:5000.
There you will see the frontend, and you can check the recommendations.
Right now, our simple algorithm is only applied on the "product overview (/producten/)" page.
